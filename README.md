Boot Camp Homework Assignment 3

This application was developed in response to the following user story:

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

When the application starts a single page is displayed with a "Generate Password" button Active and ready for the user to press.

Here is a screenshot of the application:

When the Generate Password Button is pressed the user is presented with a series of prompts asking how many and what types of characters the user would like included in the password.

The password has to be between 8 and 128 characters and the user chooses if upper case, lower case, numeric and special characters are to be included in the password.

When the password has been generated based on the users responses to the length and types of characters a random password is generated and displayed on the page where the user can see it.
